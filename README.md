## Testing

Testing progressed at every stage of this project. This ensured that most issues were fixed before the website was finished. Chrome DevTools were utilised when building the website to help with troubleshooting as the website transformed. 

The following issues were raised during my project meeting with my mentor:

*

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML and CSS pages.

### Fixed Bugs

1. The Fontawesome icons did not render properly when wrappen in an achor element. I fixed this by wrapping them in a button instead and utilising JavaScript to make sure each button leads to the correct source. 

### Test Cases

I have fully tested the website using Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on desktop (HP Pavilion Convertible 14 inch) and mobile (Samsung Note9). 

It was ensured that through the testing process content was responsive using the Google Developer Tools.
