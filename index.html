            <h3>Bitcoin</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group of
                people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need
                for intermediaries such as banks. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and
                recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there is a finite
                supply of them - 21 million - and they are created through a process called mining.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early days, it was mostly used by tech enthusiasts and libertarians who saw it as a way to bypass
                traditional financial systems. However, over time it has gained mainstream acceptance and is now widely
                used and accepted as a form of payment for goods and services. Despite some volatility, the value of
                Bitcoin has risen dramatically since its creation, leading it to be considered as a potential store of
                value or digital gold.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethereum</h3>
            <p>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts
                and decentralized applications (dApps). It was first proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and officially
                launched in 2015. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for
                transactions and computational services on the network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike Bitcoin, which was primarily designed as a digital currency, Ethereum is a more general purpose
                blockchain with the ability to run decentralized applications, which can be programmed to automatically
                execute when certain conditions are met. This allows for a wide range of potential use cases, such as
                decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
            </p>
            <p>
                Ethereum is also designed to support multiple programming languages, enabling developers to build
                applications on the Ethereum blockchain using familiar languages such as JavaScript and C++.</p>
            </p>

        <div class="tabs__tab" id="tab_3" data-tab-info>
            <h3>Binance</h3>
            <p>Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, which includes the Binance
                exchange and various other Binance-branded products and services. Binance is one of the largest
                cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and BNB is used as the primary token for all transactions and
                fees within the Binance ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Binance Coin was originally issued in 2017 as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, and later
                migrated to its own blockchain called Binance Chain in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                BNB can be used to pay for trading fees on the Binance exchange and other Binance-related services such
                as staking, lending, and participating in token sales. It also has other use cases such as paying for
                transaction fees on decentralized applications that have integrated Binance Smart Chain, and for
                participating in token sales on Binance Launchpad.

            <h3>Ripple</h3>
            <p>Ripple (XRP) is a digital asset used to facilitate fast, low-cost international money transfers. Created
                in 2012 by Ripple Labs, it enables instant and direct transfer of money between parties. It also reduces
                the need for pre-funding and is used by financial institutions and payment providers. XRP can also
                represent other assets and is used as a digital reserve asset on other blockchain networks. Its
                consensus protocol, the XRP Ledger, is open-source and decentralized.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ripple is unique among cryptocurrencies in that it has a strong focus on partnerships with financial
                institutions and banks. The company has established partnerships with major financial institutions such
                as Santander, American Express and Standard Chartered to utilize its technology for cross-border
                payments. Ripple's technology allows for faster and cheaper cross-border payments compared to
                traditional methods, and is being piloted and implemented by these institutions.
